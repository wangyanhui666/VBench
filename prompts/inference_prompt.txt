Waves crash against a rugged shoreline, creating a rhythmic and soothing sound as they break against the rocks. The rocks are jagged and uneven, with a rich brown color, partially covered in white foam from the waves. The water is a deep blue-green color, reflecting the sunlight and creating a sparkling effect on the surface. The camera is positioned at a distance, providing a wide view of the shoreline and the vast expanse of the ocean.
